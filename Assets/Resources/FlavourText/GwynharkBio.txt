Once a member of the Beaustiers, a group of elite rangers stationed at the border of France's Darkwood, Gwynhark Laval abandoned his oath to pursue the life of a thief and gambler.  His coin and faith are one in the same; held close, and sporadically flippant.   A failed attempt to steal from a high-security vault is where H.E.L found him.  They assailed him not with the mightiest hammer of the law, but curiosity.  A gemstone to be appraised, he was, and so the League proposed an offer he could not refuse.  Freedom, and money.
In recent times, Gwynhark penchant for thievery has quelled, and the shades of his honour as a ranger are slowly emerging.  Before this contract, he worked for a lesser branch of H.E.L; the Noblesse Oblige.  He intends to return to his quiet life... should lady luck permit it.

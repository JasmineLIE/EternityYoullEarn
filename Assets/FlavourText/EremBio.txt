A researcher from the prestigous Noblesse family, Erem's name is shrouded in infamy.  They have an extensive background in law, having been trained since childhood in prospect of leading H.E.L's legal affairs.  After two years of a promising career, Erem abandoned law to pursue an unyielding passion in history and ancient cultures.  Their actions stripped the influence the Noblesse Oblige held over H.E.L, which led to the ex-communication from the rest of their family.  While their journey was not easy, nor forgiving, Erem is happy with who they are; renewed, and hopeful.
Erem accepted this contract within a heartbeat, thus dragging in their personal expeditionist, Gwynhark.  Their mind is restless, and their hands crave resolve.  The matter of life and death is trivial.  Truth is eternal.

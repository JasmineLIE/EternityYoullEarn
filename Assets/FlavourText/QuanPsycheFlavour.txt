Quan speaks little outside of her station, but her effort is unparalleled.  It is clear she is pushing on despite mental taxation.
Quan seems wary.  Not of your situation; not of The Gate; but of you.  She keeps exchanges with you short.
Quan lingers by The Gate outside of her tasks.  A peaceful acceptance has washed over her.
Resolve drives her forward.  You still cannot quite read her thoughts, but she has become aware of her limits, and goals, whatever that may be.

Understanding The Objective
You and your companions are trapped deep in the mountains.  Luckily, you have been spared mercy; there is a strange, temporal phenomenon affecting this place.  You feel no hunger, no thirst, and you do not need sleep to function.  Even better, the Gates of the lost kingdom stand in front of you.  It is barred by multiple seals, which you have deduced can only be unlocked by gathering and activating enough artifacts.   The indicator on The Gate shows your progress towards breaking the next seal.
